I made a change in your SDES.java file. It can now encypt and decrypt larger data. Originally you had it so only a single block was encypted/decrypted. It now takes larger files and breakes them into blocks that is encypted/decrypted.

The instructions want only 5 file. SDES, TripleSDES, CASCII, This file as doc not a txt and the file I called Crack.java. I think she wants us to include our solutions as a main method in SDES and TripleSDES. I'm also not sure what she wants as a screenshot.
